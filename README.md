# Finance Plotter

Author: Oliver Ravnholdt

This is a small project that I made to practice my python developing skills.
Simply just add stock or crypto names like (TSLA, AMZN, BTC-USD) in the stocks.txt file.
NOTE: Only 1 stock pr. line

The script will then gather the stock data using yfinance and plot it in a dynamic grid using matplotlib.

Run main.py to get and plot the data.
